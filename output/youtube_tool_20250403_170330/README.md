# CrewAI - YouTube Transcript Management Tool

## Project Overview

CrewAI is a powerful tool designed for managing and processing YouTube transcript operations. Leveraging the MCP tool framework, this project provides functionalities for configuring enhanced logging, tracking operations, and utilizing the `pydantic` library for structured input parameters. With CrewAI, developers can seamlessly integrate transcript retrieval, analysis, and manipulation into their applications, enhancing the overall user experience.

## Installation Instructions

To get started with CrewAI, follow these installation instructions:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed on your machine. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Required Dependencies

You will need to install the following dependencies:

- `pydantic`
- `requests` (for making API calls to YouTube)
- `loguru` (for enhanced logging)

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install pydantic requests loguru
```

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CrewAI.git
   cd CrewAI
   ```

2. **Configure API Keys:**

   You need to obtain a YouTube Data API key to access transcript data. Follow these steps:
   - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
   - Create a new project.
   - Enable the YouTube Data API for your project.
   - Create credentials (API key) and copy it.

   Create a configuration file named `config.py` in the root directory of the project and add your API key:

   ```python
   YOUTUBE_API_KEY = 'YOUR_YOUTUBE_API_KEY_HERE'
   ```

## Usage Examples

Here are some usage examples to help you get started with CrewAI:

### Retrieving a YouTube Transcript

To retrieve a transcript for a specific YouTube video:

```python
from crew import YouTubeTranscriptManager

video_id = 'YOUR_VIDEO_ID_HERE'
transcript_manager = YouTubeTranscriptManager()
transcript = transcript_manager.get_transcript(video_id)
print(transcript)
```

### Analyzing a Transcript

To analyze the retrieved transcript:

```python
from crew import TranscriptAnalyzer

transcript_data = transcript_manager.get_transcript(video_id)
analyzer = TranscriptAnalyzer(transcript_data)
analysis_result = analyzer.analyze()
print(analysis_result)
```

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

```
CrewAI/
│
├── agents.py          # Contains agent definitions for handling specific tasks.
├── tasks.py           # Defines task operations for transcript management.
├── crew.py            # Core functionality and main processing logic.
├── main.py            # Entry point for executing the tool.
└── run_agent.py       # Script to run the agent operations.
```

## Troubleshooting Tips

- **Issue: API Key errors**
  - Ensure that you have enabled the YouTube Data API and that your API key is correctly configured in `config.py`.

- **Issue: Missing dependencies**
  - Double-check that all required dependencies are installed. You may run `pip install -r requirements.txt` if you have a requirements file.

- **Issue: Logging not working**
  - Verify that you have configured logging correctly in your main script and that you have the `loguru` library installed.
