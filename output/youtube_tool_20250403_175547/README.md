# CrewAI: YouTube Transcript Management Tool

## Project Overview

The "tools" MCP tool for CrewAI is designed to manage and process YouTube transcript operations. This tool provides a robust framework for developers to retrieve, analyze, and manipulate YouTube video transcripts. With enhanced logging capabilities and the use of the `pydantic` library for structured input parameters, it enables seamless integration of transcript handling into applications.

## Installation Instructions

To get started with the CrewAI tools, you will need to install the required dependencies. The following steps will guide you through the installation process:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/crewai-tools.git
   cd crewai-tools
   ```

2. **Install required dependencies:**

   It is recommended to use a virtual environment. You can create one using `venv`:

   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

   Then, install required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:
   - `pydantic`
   - `requests`
   - Any other necessary libraries listed in `requirements.txt`.

## Setup Instructions

Before you can use the tool, you will need to set up your YouTube Data API key:

1. **Obtain a YouTube Data API Key:**
   - Visit the [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/).
   - Create a new project or select an existing one.
   - Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Library" and enable the YouTube Data API v3.
   - Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials" and create an API key.

2. **Configure your API key:**
   - Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of the project.
   - Add the following line to the `.env` file:

     ```
     YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     ```

## Usage Examples

Here are some examples of how to use the CrewAI tools for various transcript operations:

### Retrieve YouTube Transcript

```python
from tools import YouTubeTranscriptManager

transcript_manager = YouTubeTranscriptManager(video_id='VIDEO_ID')
transcript = transcript_manager.retrieve_transcript()
print(transcript)
```

### Analyze Transcript

```python
from tools import YouTubeTranscriptAnalyzer

analyzer = YouTubeTranscriptAnalyzer(transcript=transcript)
analysis_results = analyzer.analyze_sentiment()
print(analysis_results)
```

### Manipulate Transcript

```python
from tools import YouTubeTranscriptManipulator

manipulator = YouTubeTranscriptManipulator(transcript=transcript)
modified_transcript = manipulator.filter_by_keywords(keywords=['python', 'AI'])
print(modified_transcript)
```

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

```
crewai-tools/
│
├── agents.py             # Contains agent definitions for processing transcripts
├── tasks.py              # Defines tasks related to transcript management
├── crew.py               # Main crew management functionalities
├── main.py               # Entry point for executing the tool
├── run_agent.py          # Script to run specific agents
└── tools.py              # Core functionality for managing YouTube transcripts
```

## Troubleshooting Tips

- Ensure that your API key is valid and has the necessary permissions to access the YouTube Data API.
- Check your internet connection if you encounter issues with API requests.
- If you encounter dependency-related errors, ensure that all required packages are installed as per the `requirements.txt`.
- For any unexpected behavior, enable debug logging within the tool by configuring the logging settings in your application.
