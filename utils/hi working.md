User Message: hi

Please provide your analysis in the following JSON format:
{
    "analysis_type": "simple_response" | "full_implementation",
    "requires_additional_agents": boolean,
    "project_specification": string,
    "reasoning": string
}

Guidelines for analysis:
1. Use "simple_response" if this is a general question, greeting, or clarification
2. Use "full_implementation" if this requires creating or significantly modifying agents
3. Set requires_additional_agents to true ONLY for agent creation requests that need architecture and implementation
4. Provide detailed project_specification for full implementations
5. Include your reasoning for the decision

For agent creation requests:
- Always set requires_additional_agents to true
- Include comprehensive project specifications
- Proceed directly with implementation without asking questions

For general conversation or simple requests:
- Set requires_additional_agents to false
- Keep project_specification brief
- Explain why a simple response is sufficient

## Reasoner Agent Interaction

### System Prompt
```
<bound method Agent.system_prompt of Agent(model=OpenAIModel(model_name='gpt-4o-mini', system_prompt_role=None), name='reasoner', end_strategy='early', model_settings=None)>
```
### Output
```
To create a multi-agent CrewAI system that can search the web, analyze findings, and generate comprehensive reports on emerging tech trends, I will first define the roles and responsibilities of each agent as well as the necessary components, external dependencies, and the testing strategy.

### Multi-Agent Architecture Document

#### 1. Multi-Agent Architecture Diagram

[User Input] → [Search Agent] → [Analysis Agent] → [Report Generation Agent]
                              ↘
                             [Data Store]
```

#### 2. Agent Roles and Responsibilities

- **Search Agent**
  - **Responsibilities**:
    - Perform searches on the web for relevant tech trends.
    - Gather information from multiple sources.
    - Filter and compile the data based on relevance.
  - **Key Functionalities**:
    - Web scraping capabilities.
    - Application of search algorithms.
    - Basic NLP for content extraction.

- **Analysis Agent**
  - **Responsibilities**:
    - Analyze the collected data from the Search Agent.
    - Identify patterns, trends, and key insights.
    - Perform sentiment analysis and statistical evaluations.
  - **Key Functionalities**:
    - Data processing and statistical analysis.
    - Machine learning for pattern recognition.
    - Visualization tools for presenting findings.

- **Report Generation Agent**
  - **Responsibilities**:
    - Create comprehensive reports based on the analysis.
    - Summarize findings in a user-friendly format.
    - Include visual aids and references.
  - **Key Functionalities**:
    - Natural Language Generation (NLG) for report writing.
    - Integration with document creation tools (PDF, DOCX).
    - Automatic referencing of sources.

#### 3. External Dependencies
- **Search Agent**:
  - Web scraping libraries (e.g., Beautiful Soup, Scrapy).
  - APIs for search engines (e.g., Google Custom Search API).

- **Analysis Agent**:
  - Data analysis libraries (e.g., Pandas, NumPy).
  - Machine learning frameworks (e.g., Scikit-learn, TensorFlow).
  - Visualization tools (e.g., Matplotlib, Tableau).

- **Report Generation Agent**:
  - Document formatting libraries (e.g., ReportLab, docx).
  - NLG tools or APIs (e.g., GPT-3, OpenAI's DALL-E for visuals).

#### 4. Testing Strategy
- **Search Agent**:
  - Unit tests for web scraping functions to ensure accurate data gathering.
  - Integration tests with the Analysis Agent to verify data integrity.

- **Analysis Agent**:
  - Unit tests for data processing and analysis algorithms.
  - Performance testing to ensure timely analysis of large data sets.
  
- **Report Generation Agent**:
  - Unit tests for the report formatting and generation functionality.
  - User acceptance testing (UAT) to evaluate report readability and usefulness.

### Conclusion
This scope document delivers a robust outline for creating a multi-agent CrewAI system focused on technology trend analysis. Each agent is specialized but collaborates to produce comprehensive insights. The next step includes further detailing inter-agent communication patterns, data flow between agents, and configurations for scalable operation.

If more specific patterns or documentation are required, I will retrieve relevant documentation to assist with that.

## Scope Definition Interaction

### System Prompt
```

    User AI Agent Request: create a agent A crew that can search the web, analyze findings, and generate comprehensive reports on emerging tech trends.

    If the user message is too brief or unclear (e.g., a simple 'hi'), please ask for clarification and do not create a detailed scope document.
    Otherwise, create a detailed scope document for the AI agent including:
    - Architecture diagram
    - Core components
    - External dependencies
    - Testing strategy

    NOTE: Do not load documentation automatically. If you require documentation references during the process,
    please call the tool 'retrieve_relevant_documentation' to fetch the necessary information.

Input received: Analyze this user request and determine the appropriate response strategy:

User Message: create a agent A crew that can search the web, analyze findings, and generate comprehensive reports on emerging tech trends.

Please provide your analysis in the following JSON format:
{
    "analysis_type": "simple_response" | "full_implementation",
    "requires_additional_agents": boolean,
    "project_specification": string,
    "reasoning": string
}

Guidelines for analysis:
1. Use "simple_response" if this is a general question, greeting, or clarification
2. Use "full_implementation" if this requires creating or significantly modifying agents
3. Set requires_additional_agents to true ONLY for agent creation requests that need architecture and implementation
4. Provide detailed project_specification for full implementations
5. Include your reasoning for the decision

For agent creation requests:
- Always set requires_additional_agents to true
- Include comprehensive project specifications
- Proceed directly with implementation without asking questions

For general conversation or simple requests:
- Set requires_additional_agents to false
- Keep project_specification brief
- Explain why a simple response is sufficient
